# Vehicle-speed-detection
Vehicle Speed Detection using YOLOv8 is a real-time computer vision system that detects vehicles in video streams, assigns unique IDs, and estimates their speed using frame-by-frame tracking and distance calculations. It's built with OpenCV, YOLOv8, and Python for practical traffic monitoring applications.
